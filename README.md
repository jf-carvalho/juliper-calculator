This is a strictly a personal project.

Although I'm not a frontend developer, I used my coding skills to make something that could be really useful to my domestical finance administration. Every single month I use this tool I developed with Vue to reactively calculate proportional financial participation between me and my beloved beautiful wife ❤️ once we are remunerated differently.

It might not be the best Vue code in the galaxy but it really helps me solving a real life problem. Could it be an Excel sheet? Sure! But where's the fun in that?
